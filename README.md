Tech Store

This is a small simple django project created to be like an ecommerce store.<br>
This was used to help me better understand django with working on models, urls, signals, and more.<br>
Improving on using more than one app.<br>
Also helping me understand using framework such as django restframework. <br>
Its not finished just yet as i need to implement the use of a cart function and fix the view for mobile devices
